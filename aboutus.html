    <h1>Valhalla Space Group</h1>
    Valhalla was founded in 122PCE as a space expiration outfitter, specializing in the research and design of human habitats and vehicles.  We designed the first renditions of Yggdrasil habitat, Slepnir ATV and Lamellar Suit amongst many others within those first years.  we were contracted to many other exploration companies but never intended doing explorations ourselves. That was until our newest head JoAnne Ripley came to the company and turned it onto its head.  While our heart is still in the production of interplanetary exploration research and development, we have started using our knowledge of production to make our own alien discoveries.  </p><p>
      Since the beginning Valhalla has prided itself with its minimally invasive designs with maximal comfort for any crew living in our spaces.  Valhalla group was also on the pioneering side of the <a href=””> Footprint act </a> with our explorations never lasting more then twenty years, with no more then a single human habitat on any given world.  in addition to our designs being either packable or biodegradable on applicable planets.  </p>

    <h1>Frigg Research & Exploration Experts</h1>
    <p>FREE (Frigg Research & Exploration Experts) is Valhalla Space Group’s longest mission that set out in 145 PCE and will be on the ground until 165 PCE. It is a minimally invasive expedition of the planet of Nótt. The goals of this expedition is to discover, define and seek out the fauna and flora of the area around the base of operations. While we do not know exactly what we will find we are sending pharmaceutical and ecological experts to see if any discoveries on Nott will help us here at Home.  Much like many other space exploration companies FREE is dedicated to furthering mankind and helping heal Home through our discoveries. </p>
    <h2>About Nótt</h2><p>
      <p>Nott is located in the Árvakr solar system in the M31 galaxy.  Nótt is a tidally-locked planet and while this plant type was previously thought to be inhabitable there is a strip of 415 miles that is called the Dawn Zone in which life flourishes.  This small strip of land wrapping from poll to poll gets just enough light to sustain life without drying out the land to a crisp.  Though this means that this strip of land is ever in the same amount of light never day nor night. a year on Nótt is the equivalent of 380 days on Home.</P> <p>
        Nott is home to many creatures not too dissimilar to animals you may find here at Home, but they ahave3 evolved in a completely different environment then our own and while they may have similar external characteristics their internal makeup behavior and evolution is completely separate from our own. to learn more about the animals and environment of Nótt look at the <a href = “’> our discoveries page </a> </p>

    <div class= "cullum2">
    <p> The current set up of the Yggdrasil compound found on Nótt is made out of five pressurized compartments and one unpressurized compartment.  The five pressurized compartments are  </p> 
  <dl>
    <dt>A: Lab</dt>
    <dt>B: main life-support</dt>
    <dt>wet rooms</dt>
    <dd>C: showers</dd>
    <dd>D: stageing area</dd>
    <dd>E: lavitory</dd>
    <dt>living area</dt>
    <dd>K: recreation room</dd>
    <dd>L: dormitories</dd>
    <dt>J:seckondary life-support</dt>
    <p>One must equip a Lamellar Suit to go into the unpressurized areas like the garage secondary staging area and the airlock and decontamination area.  within the larger unpressurized dome there is a small, pressurized room witch work as a quarantine area.  this area would be used in the scenarios of a Lamellar Suit or Slepnir malfunction, any signs of sickness or catastrophic depressurization of the Yggdrasil system.   </p>
  </dl>

</div> 
     <p> Yggdrasil is our modular human habitat system.  All of the modules are able to be built no matter how large in under an hour.  These buildings are flexible and based off of a geodesic design, they can attach to each other and be dismantled all while inside and under pressure.  Depending on the terrain the Yggdrasil system can be designed to be kept at a negative or positive pressure. Yggdrasill’s support network is made out of an aluminum-like compound, the body made out of a Kevlar-nanotube and reflective flexible steel mesh creating an airtight modular setup.  </p> <p>
      Depending on the use of the module they will either be able to be completely dismaneled and brought back into orbit or for shorter expeditions they can be charged with local xenobackteria fungi and other decomposers to biodegrade after their use on whatever planet they are being used on. longer stays can be set to do the same after seeds of these decomposers are placed within the walls of the domes.  Each dome is highly customizable from labs and garages to kitchens and bedrooms </p> <p>
      The Yiggdrasil kept on Nott is our best model yet.  The safety of Nótt only comes second to the safety of our crew. While Nótt has an atmosphere much like our own the Yiggrisl there is kept under negative pressure as to ensure that any human contaminates are to stay within the dome. No crew member may leave the pressurized area without wearing a Lamellar Suit and if any catastrophic failure happens a antibiotic charge would be release within the affected area within seconds of the breach.  </p> <p>
      Yiggdasil is not just the geodesic structures though, there are tunnels connecting the different structures and are designed to detach, seal and retract in seconds of any sign of compromise to any of the domes.  These tunnels also work as airlocks if a crew member is unable to reach the main airlock.  </p> <p>
      The main structure is also protected by a 15ft electrified fence, to discourage any animals from interacting with the dome.  The yiggraisl kept on Nótt is powered by the highly reactive geothermal energy found in this area of the planet. Though there are many other ways that our domes get their energy weather solar, wind, or nuclear, whatever energy is the best match for the planet we are exploring</p>

  <div class = "showoff biggerimg ">
    <h1>slepnir</h1> <br>
    <img  src="images/useimg/truck.gif" alt=""> 
    <p>Slepnir is our ATV designed to be fast, safe and efficient, battery-powered and highly adaptable; Slepnirs are one of our most proud achievements as they have everything a human needs in almost every way it is  a traveling Yggdrasil unit with decontamination, energy generation, sleeping quarters, lab equipment and access to uplink with Home and bases around the solar system. They are designed to be lived in, in case of long expeditions or emergencies.  The interior is highly modifiable as new needs pop up, it can comfortably hold and camp three people and sustain up to six in case of a major emergency.   </p> <p>
      Slepnir is made out of the same base materials as the Yggdrasil systems.  They are one of the first things to land on any given planet and one of the last to be deconstructed and brought back into orbit Slepnir need to be tough and fixable if anything were to go wrong. And here at Valhalla Group we made sure that is possible almost all of the parts of a Slepnir unit can be removed and replaced easily usually within an hour with trained technicians.  While Slepnir is our newest design and the newest Slepnir is being used on Nótt we have full confidence in its ability to get the job done.</p>

        <img  src="images/useimg/suit.png" alt=" ">
        <h1>Lamellar Suit</h1>
        <p>Lamellar Suits are one of Valhalla group’s oldest designs. A multipurpose pressurized walking suit, that is specialized for planets with atmospheres but can be used in small amounts in a vacuum and under water up to 10m deep.  Lamellar Suits are made out of a lightweight rubberized carbon nanotube fabric with external pads, heating and cooling system and waterproofing. Internally it has a layer of cotton and moisture wicking interlacing. Additional light systems, tool belts and safety gear can be attached and removed as needed. Though with this flexibility of use the main perpous of the Lamellar Suit is to protect its wearier from the outside and the outside from the wearer.  It is equally a HAZMAT suit as much as it is a space suit or exploration equipment.  </p><p>
          While the entreaty of the Lamellar Suit is state of the art here at Vallhalla we are most proud of the air system.  while the suit is can be equipped with tanks and/or a rebreathing system the Lamellar Suits that are being used on Nótt and a few other planets with biospheres, can supplement or completely use the air around the suit; filtering any air coming in from contamination or noxious gasses.  Then on the out breath It also filters the air to match the area and remove any human pathogens. For as hostile any planet may be any germ to get out of human containment could spell disaster for the planet’s ecology.  </p>
