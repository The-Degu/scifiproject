    <h1>The Crew</h1>
   <p> FREE’s crew are the highest qualified individuals that reside at Valhalla Space Group. These individuals had to go through a rigors selection and training proses. Starting form hun dreds of candidates to the six you see here.  
</p> <p>
FREE is a twenty-year mission and no single crew member may stay for more then three years on the planet.  As to curb mental and physical health conditions associated with long times away from the home base.  Though they may return after two years off of the planet and they still are canadines and successfully Nótt the selection and training again. 
</p><p>
One does not just need academics to enter the FREE program.  As the crew is so small secondary skills are key, along with physical aptitude and one has to get along with the other crew members as well.  Once you’re on the planet the earliest you can get off is a year later so you better get along with your bunk buddies.
