          <p><strong>pseudo-mammal </strong></p>
          <p>/so͞odō/ˈ /maməl/</p>
          <p>Adjective</p>
          <p>Any non-earth animal that is mammal-like due to convergent evolution.&nbsp; Any animal that has two or more of the key mammalian features (fur, live birth, produces milk) and is not terrestrial in nature may have this label attacked to them</p>
          <p><strong>N&oacute;ttic</strong></p>
          <p>the demonym for the planet of N&oacute;tt. What the living creatures on N&oacute;tt is called</p>
      
        </div> <div class = "textparttwo">
          <p> ótt is just as diverse and interesting as our own home though with the majority of its land uninhabitable by any life the band around the planet where it is perpetually twilight or dawn the fauna flourishes. These are just a few of the most charismatic Pseudo-mammals that can be found in the small section we have explored.  With our minimally-invasive efforts it takes much longer to find and describe new species though the most interesting may be added as our explorers expand their treks into the wilderness. 
          </p><p>
          There has been no sign of intelligent llife on this planet but there are plenty of animals that resemble our own.  while these animals may look like something similar as what we may find on our home there are quite a few differences. Not the least of which is that unless stated otherwise the majority of the animals on this planet use three partners to  reproduce. This system has been observed but is not yet understood. There are many other differences like this throughout the animal population of Nótt.

          <h2>Sulfur Goat</h2>
          <p><i>Phoenicopteri Capra</i></p>
          <p>Sulfur goats can be found by the geothermal ponds and near vents filter feeding off of the bacteria and brine shrimp-like pseudo-crustaceans found there. </p><p>

            Their tough skin protects them from the toxic waters. Along with their wiry hair not growing in places of common contact. Theorized to keep the fur from holding the irritating waters to the skin. </p><p>
            
            Their flesh is also toxic and deeply unpleasant due to their toxic diet. So their bright coloring might be a sign to would-be predators that they are unpalatable, though faux-cats have been recorded hunting and eating sulfur goats

              <h2>Loricant</h2>
              <p><i>Ille Lingua Diu Alta</i></p>
              <p>oricant were the first pseudo-mammal defined and logged from Nótt their tall stature making them easy to spot on their flat home.  </p><p>

                Loricant are non-discriminate eaters observed to eat the fruits of the Ambia and ambush hunt small animals, using its long sticky tongue as a lure. </p><p>
                
                Loricant are hermaphroditic living in communal herds of up to fifteen individuals.  Musk Rutters and Sulfur goats tend to gather around Loricant as to use them as guard towers and protectors.  Adult Loricants are generally too large and strong to be taken down by predators.

          <h2>Faux-Cat</h2>
          <p><i>Leo Falsum Brunneis</i></p>
          <p>this pseudo-mammal can be found prowling the rocks of the darker edges of the Nótt, it specializes in hunting Musk Rutters and sulfur goats. </p><p>
            they live in family clans of up to six individuals, composed  a breeding pair and their cubs. the cubs live with the breeding pair for up to five years before leaving once reaching sexual maturity.</p><p>
              The Faux-cat has a fleshy "star" at the front of its face, used for both breeding displays and to help track its pray. The star is able to flip almost inside out and as shown below during displays it spreads wide across the face, engorging with blood displaying a bright red color.

              <p><i>Tum Figere Cervos Vespertilio</i></p>
              <p>this pseudo-mammal can be found in the planes and rocky steps of the planet.
              </p><p>
              they are able to see minimal amounts of light and some color, the Bat-ear is very near-sighted and depends on  echolocation for any object beyond its dependable area of sight. </p><p>
              They a single tooth outside of their mouth used to scrape their food mostly lichen and moss off of the rocky outcroppings of their homes.
