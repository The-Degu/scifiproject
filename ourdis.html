            their tough skin protects them from the toxic waters. Along with their wiery hair not growing in places of common contact. theorized to keep the fur from holding the irritating waters to the skin. </p><p>
            
            their flesh is also toxic and deeply unpleasant due to their toxic diet. So their bright coloring might be a sign to would-be preditors that they are inplatable, though faux-cats have been recorded hunting and eating Sulfur goats
